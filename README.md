# On the Topic Of Business
On the Topic of Business: Takeaways from my MBA
By: Jered Diego Linares

Version 0.0.1 (pre-apha)


# Mission and Vision
## Purpose: 
Share what I learned with those who learned with me, learned before me, and will learn after me. 


## Vision: 
This project will serve as a resource to those interested in understanding the 2-year MBA, from a single perspective at the Kellogg School of Management. I hope that it will grow and others will use it as a template to share their knowledge and experience. The end goal is an aggrigate of best practices, takeaways, and shared experiences from each program (2Y, 1Y, E&W, EMBA) for the benifit of students yet to be admitted.


# Forward
I write this document because of the the unavailability and inaccessablity of the information it contains to a student like me, before now. I made many mistakes on my path from free school lunches in my predominaltly latino grade school, to a degree in engineering and then medicine. I hope this document will show the opportunities available, and how to reach them.
