# On The Topic Of Business
"Takeaways from the MBA"
By: Jered Diego Linares


Purpose: 
Share what I learned with those who learned with me, learned before me, and will learn after me. 

Vision: 
This project will serve as a resource to those interested in understanding the 2-year M.B.A. from a single perspective at the Kellogg School of Management. I hope that it will grow and others will use it as a template to share their experieneces and eventually become a way to aggrigate best practices from each program (2Y, 1Y, E&W, EMBA) for the benifit of all. 


Planned Topics: 
1. the first
    1. the one dot one
    2. the one dot two
2. the second
